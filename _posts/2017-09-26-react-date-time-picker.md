If you are now using React, creating forms and looking for date time picker, and so confused what library that you can use because google
give you a lot of choice,
maybe you should try this library called antd. I see a lot of people using semantic-ui, but in fact, semantic doesn't have date time picker.
antd or Ant Design for React is a cool lightweight library that design for react. It has a lot of component that you can play with, the
implementation is pretty simple too, for beginner like me wkwk. This is the link for [antd](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) . <br>
Just sharing. Thanks :)
